## A script for filtering Facebook logins

It filters the correct logins from 'logins.txt' and saves both the correct and incorrect logins in two different '.txt' files.

Note: The logins.txt file should look like below:

```
emanueldeopeter2003@gmail.com	ugalimtamu
 2	fatumamwariko2004@gmail.com	saranga
 3	0765144905	0765144905
 4	Emanueldeopeter2003@gmail.com	ugalimtamu
 5	0713908464	908464
```
Note: All logins above are incorrect.

### Running the script

To run this script you must have:
- Mozilla Firefox installed and
- Mozilla Firefox's ***geckodriver*** webdriver binary extracted and placed in the right folder
 - */usr/local/bin'* for MacOS

> The download link for ***geckodriver***(For MacOS): https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases

(The script makes use of automated headless browsing)

***Happy coding!***
